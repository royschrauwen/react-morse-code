## What is it?

A web-application that translates typed input into morse code.

Typed morse code can also be translated into alphanumeric.

It also has the ability to play the generated morse code as audio.

## Made With

React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Further wishes

- It would be nice if you are able to download an audio-file with the
  morse code.
- I need to make a better looking layout. This one is very functional
  but also quite boring.
