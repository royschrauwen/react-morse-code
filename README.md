# Morse Code Translator

![Morse Code Translator Screenshot](https://github.com/royschrauwen/react-morse-code/blob/e77c5210939fdeebc862f0e5df2098e8824c68d8/morse_code_translator_screenshot.jpg)
A web-application that translates typed input into morse code.
Typed morse code can also be translated into alphanumeric.

It also has the ability to play the generated morse code as audio.

## Further wishes

It would be nice if you are able to download an audio-file with the morse code.
I need to make a better looking layout. This one is very functional but also quite boring.
